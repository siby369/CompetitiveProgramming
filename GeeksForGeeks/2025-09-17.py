Problem: Decode the String
Difficulty: Medium
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/decode-the-string2444/1

Approach:
- We need to decode an encoded string with patterns like "3[a2[c]]" â†’ "accaccacc".
- Use a stack-based approach but traverse the string **from right to left**:
  - If the current character is not '[', push it to the stack.
  - If it is '[', it indicates the start of a substring to be expanded:
    - Pop characters until ']' to build the substring (`cur`).
    - Pop any extra part that follows (`mkp`).
    - Move left to collect the full number (`p`) representing the repetition count.
    - Repeat the substring `t` times and push it back to the stack, appending `mkp`.
- At the end, the top of the stack contains the fully decoded string.

Time Complexity: O(n * k), where n = length of input string and k = maximum repeat count (since substring concatenation happens k times).
Space Complexity: O(n), for the stack used to hold characters and substrings during decoding.
