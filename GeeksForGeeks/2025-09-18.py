Problem: Next Greater Element
Difficulty: Medium
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-greater-element/1

Approach:
- For each element in the array, we want to find the next greater element to its right.
- Use a **monotonic decreasing stack** to process elements efficiently:
  - Traverse the array from right to left.
  - While the stack is not empty and the stackâ€™s top is <= current element, pop from the stack.
  - If the stack is not empty, the top is the next greater element for the current element.
  - If the stack is empty, the next greater element is -1.
  - Push the current element onto the stack.
- Return the result array.

Time Complexity: O(n), since each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.  
Space Complexity: O(n), for the stack and result array.
